Parametric DMD for Flow Reconstruction: From Canonical Cylinder Validation to Transonic Buffet Modeling
## Overview

The accurate and efficient modeling of fluid flows across varying operating conditions is a central challenge in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), particularly in the context of reduced-order modeling. Parametric Dynamic Mode Decomposition (pDMD) has emerged as a powerful data-driven technique for extracting low-dimensional representations from high-fidelity simulations or experiments. It enables interpolation of system behavior across parameter spaces, such as Reynolds number, Mach number, or angle of attack.

However, like its foundational counterpart — vanilla DMD — pDMD remains sensitive to noise and nonlinear dynamics, which limits its predictive stability and robustness. This thesis aims to develop and validate an improved version of pDMD by integrating an optimized DMD variant developed at the Institute of Fluid Mechanics, TU Dresden.
